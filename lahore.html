      <h1><strong><mark>Lahore becomes the most Polluted city of Pakistan</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>Lahore, the capital city of Punjab province in Pakistan, has been grappling with severe pollution issues in recent years. The city's air quality has deteriorated significantly, leading to health concerns among its residents. Factors contributing to Lahore's pollution include vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and crop burning in surrounding areas.</i></p>
    
    <p><i>The impact on daily life and public health in Lahore is profound and immediate. Residents face a constant barrage of respiratory ailments, throat infections, and eye irritation, with long-term exposure estimated to reduce average life expectancy in the region by approximately seven years. The extreme lack of visibility, which often drops to just a few meters, frequently forces the closure of major transport routes like the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway and has led to the temporary shuttering of schools and public parks to protect children and the elderly.</i></p>
