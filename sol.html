       <h1><strong><mark>Some important measures to Control Pollution</mark></strong></h1>
    <p><i>To effectively control pollution, a multifaceted approach is required that combines strict government regulation with industrial innovation and individual responsibility. At the policy level, governments must enforce stringent emission standards for factories and vehicles while incentivizing the transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Urban planning also plays a critical role, as developing robust public transportation systems and expanding green spaces within cities can significantly reduce the concentration of atmospheric pollutants. Furthermore, international cooperation is essential for addressing transboundary issues like regional smog and ocean plastic, ensuring that environmental standards are upheld across borders.On an industrial and technological scale, the focus must shift toward sustainable manufacturing and comprehensive waste management. This includes adopting closed-loop systems that prioritize recycling and the safe disposal of hazardous chemicals to prevent soil and water contamination. Industries can also implement advanced filtration technologies, such as scrubbers and wastewater treatment plants, to neutralize pollutants at the source. By investing in "green chemistry" and carbon capture technologies, the corporate sector can drastically minimize its environmental footprint while maintaining economic productivity.Finally, individual actions serve as a vital foundation for environmental preservation. Simple behavioral changes—such as reducing reliance on single-use plastics, practicing proper waste segregation, and conserving energy at home—collectively lower the demand on polluting industries. Opting for public transit, carpooling, or electric vehicles further reduces personal carbon footprints. When communities prioritize sustainable consumption and support local "greening" initiatives, they create a bottom-up pressure that complements high-level policy, leading to a cleaner and healthier global environment.</i></p>
